Recently [Peter Kofler] wrote a [blog post] in which he looks at the [Design of a Separable Transition-Diagram Compiler][the-paper] paper by [Melvin E. Conway] (which was published in 1963 and considered to be the first paper mentioning coroutines) and reimplements a basic coroutine in the modern assembly for Windows. Since I don't have access to any Windows machines, Peter kindly agreed to pair up with me on porting [the code from his blog post][the code] to macOS and 64-bit assembly. While doing this I ended up reading the paper and then cloning and refactoring the code to make it a bit simpler at the expense of the code not matching the paper anymore.

Below you will find my interpretation of the problem as described in the first two pages of the paper and solutions with/without coroutines in Kotlin and NASM (see this [github repo][github-squasher] for full source code and tests). It's worth mentioning that NASM solutions and implementation of basic coroutines are based on Peter's code.

### The problem
Imagine a simple task of replacing all occurrences of `**` (two asterisks) with `^` in a stream of data. For example, given `***abc`, the output should be `^*abc`. In the paper this process is called "squashing" and can be implemented in Kotlin as a one-liner: 
<kotlin>
fun String.squash() = this.replace("**", "^")
</kotlin>

However, there is an additional constraint which makes the problem a bit more interesting. In particular, squasher can only consume or output **one character at a time**. In Kotlin this can be expressed as an `Iterator<Char>` which wraps another `Iterator<Char>`. (In the paper the input is being read infinitely from [punch cards] but it's safe to skip these details.) 

### Kotlin implementation
Given the constraint, a straightforward squasher implementation might look like this:
<kotlin>
fun squasher(input: Iterator&lt;Char&gt;) = object : Iterator&lt;Char&gt; {
    var hasLastChar = false
    var lastChar = 0.toChar()
 
    override fun next() =
        if (hasLastChar) {
            hasLastChar = false
            lastChar
        } else {
            var char = input.next()
            if (char == '*') {
                lastChar = input.next()
                if (lastChar == '*') char = '^'
                else hasLastChar = true
            }
            char
        }

    override fun hasNext() = input.hasNext() || hasLastChar
}
</kotlin>

Because of the requirement to output only one char at a time, the code has additional non-essential complexity of keeping the state of the iterator between invocations in `hasLastChar` and `lastChar` properties. In a way, we can think about the code block guarded by `hasLastChar` as a callback or even as a [state machine] with only two states. 

This is exactly the situation when coroutines can help by "returning" values in the middle of a function and resuming from that point later. The squasher implementation below doesn't need the `hasLastChar` flag since this logic is already embedded in the control flow of the code. 

<kotlin>
fun squasher(input: Iterator&lt;Char&gt;): Iterator&lt;Char&gt; = sequence {
    while (input.hasNext()) {
        val char = input.next()
        if (char != '*') yield(char)
        else {
            val lastChar = input.next()
            if (lastChar == '*') {
                yield('^')
            } else {
                yield(char)
                yield(lastChar)
            }
        }
    }
}.iterator()
</kotlin>

I don't think there is anything particularly revealing in the examples above but it feels nice to be able to translate such an old problem to a modern language and it, hopefully, explains the problem domain before diving into assembly code.


### NASM implementation (with functions)
From this point, I'll assume that you are familiar with x86 assembler enough to be able to get the gist of the following code snippets (which are written using [NASM] and can be found in this [github repo][github-squasher]). If not, you can try [this intro][x86asm-guide-1], [this guide][x86asm-guide-2] or [this article][asm64bit] on 64-bit assembly.

For simplicity, the NASM implementation doesn't attempt to mimic an `Iterator` but rather reads a fixed size input from stdin.
The `main` function is just a loop which for each input char calls `squasher` and prints to stdout one character at a time:

<x86asm>
main:
        _call   read_input
        mov     qword [hasLastChar], FALSE
.loop:
        _call   squasher        ; squash char from input and put result into rax
        _call   write           ; print char from rax

        mov     rax, [i]
        cmp     rax, INPUT_SIZE 
        jne     .loop           ; jump back if i != INPUT_SIZE 
</x86asm>

The `squasher` function uses `next_char` to get the next input character and puts the output character into the `rax` register before returning to `main`. Similar to the Kotlin version without coroutines, `squasher` has to keep global state and includes additional logic to return `lastChar`.

<x86asm>
squasher:
        mov     rax, [hasLastChar]
        cmp     rax, FALSE
        je      .no_lastChar
        mov     qword [hasLastChar], FALSE
        mov     rax, [lastChar]
        _ret
.no_lastChar:
        _call   next_char                  ; puts return value into rax
        cmp     rax, '*'
        je     .check_second_asterisk
        _ret
.check_second_asterisk:
        mov     rbx, rax                   ; temporary save first char to rbx
        _call   next_char                  ; puts return value into rax
        cmp     rax, '*'
        je      .do_squashing

        mov     [lastChar], rax
        mov     qword [hasLastChar], TRUE  ; remember to write lastChar next time
        mov     rax, rbx                   ; load first char from rbx
        _ret
.do_squashing:
        mov     rax, '^'
        _ret
</x86asm>

As you may have noticed, the code above uses `_call` and `_ret` macros (instead of built-in `call` and `ret`). This is to show implementation details of simplistic function [calling convention].
<x86asm>
%macro _call 1
        mov     rdx, %%_end
        push    rdx         ; save returning point on stack
        jmp     %1          ; call sub-function
%%_end: nop                 ; returning point
%endmacro

%macro _ret 0
        pop     rdx         ; load returning point from stack
        jmp     rdx         ; jump back into caller function
%endmacro
</x86asm>


### NASM implementation (with coroutines)
Since x86 assembler doesn't have coroutines, let's implement them. The idea is to reserve additional memory for each coroutine to store the address of its resuming point (initially set to the first instruction of coroutine) so when coroutine is called again, it continues from where it left off.
<x86asm>
section .data
instruction_at_main:       dq    main     ; stores resuming point of main
instruction_at_squasher:   dq    squasher ; stores resuming point of squasher
</x86asm>
To pass control to a coroutine we can use the following `co_call` macro. The macro expects to be called from a coroutine so it updates the resuming point of the current coroutine (in case the coroutine gets control back some time later). Then the macro looks up the resuming point of the coroutine it's about to call and jumps to that address. No doubt, this is a toy implementation which doesn't save/restore registers or stack when switching between coroutines but, hopefully, it's simple enough to illustrate the concept.

<x86asm>
%macro co_call 1
        ; update resuming point of the current coroutine
        pop     rdx                     ; load address of the store
        mov     rcx, %%_end             ;
        mov     [rdx], rcx              ; update resuming point in the store

        ; pass control to the next coroutine
        mov     rdx, instruction_at_%1  ; get address of the store
        push    rdx                     ; save address of the store for later
        jmp     [rdx]                   ; resume the next coroutine

%%_end: nop                             ; resuming point
%endmacro
</x86asm>

This `main` function is the same as the version without coroutines except for the use of `co_call` macro and having to prepare the stack so the macro thinks it's called from a coroutine.
<x86asm>
main:
        call    read_input
        mov     rax, instruction_at_main
        push    rax             ; prepare stack for coroutine call
.loop:
        co_call squasher        ; squash char from input and put result into rax
        call    write           ; print char from rax

        mov     rax, [i]
        cmp     rax, INPUT_SIZE 
        jne     .loop           ; jump back if i != INPUT_SIZE
</x86asm>

There are more changes in `squasher` though. The most interesting change is that there are no "returns" because conceptually `squasher` is not any different from the `main` coroutine and there is nowhere to return to, so `squasher` can only call sub-functions or pass control to another coroutine. As a consequence the `squasher` now is an infinite loop (see `jmp squasher` instructions). Similar to the Kotlin version with coroutines, `squasher` doesn't need the `hasLastChar` variable anymore because the branching is stored as a resuming point.
<x86asm>
squasher:
        call    next_char
        cmp     rax, '*'
        je     .check_second_asterisk
        co_call main
        jmp     squasher

.check_second_asterisk:
        mov     rbx, rax                ; temporary save first char to rbx
        call    next_char
        cmp     rax, '*'
        je      .do_squashing

        mov     [lastChar], rax         ; save rax so its not erased by main
        mov     rax, rbx                ; load first char from rbx
        co_call main

        mov     rax, [lastChar]
        co_call main
        jmp     squasher

.do_squashing:
        mov     rax, '^'
        co_call main
        jmp     squasher
</x86asm>

### How is that different from threads?
Fundamentally, OS kernel switching between threads has no magic and is based on the [instruction pointer] manipulation similar to the macro above (for example, see [this][kernel-switch] stackoverflow question). The main difference compared to coroutines is that conceptually switching between threads is preemptive, i.e. the function which is being executed doesn't decide when to switch to another function, instead, thread scheduler does it. Another difference is that thread scheduler normally doesn't provide any guarantees about which CPU core thread will run on and, therefore, the need for "thread safety" which really is all about "multi-core safety". (As an interesting side note there are no special assembly instructions for switching between CPU cores. Instead, several CPUs just run instructions independently with access to common shared memory. See [The Unofficial SMP FAQ]). Overall, even though the underlying mechanism might be similar, coroutines give you more control over context switches compared to threads.

### Summary
Kotlin being a high-level language has a more sophisticated coroutine implementation, than the one shown above, with a lot of details related to other language features and type system but at the core it's the same trick of storing the latest entry point of a coroutine and, when the coroutine is resumed, jumping to the right part of the code (you can find the implementation in [CoroutineTransformerMethodVisitor] which uses [tableswitch] instruction to do the jump). 

Hopefully, this blog helps with understanding basic coroutine implementation details. For a description of coroutine flavours from the point of view of programming language user, you can try reading the following posts:
