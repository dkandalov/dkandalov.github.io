Here is the video of me at [KotlinConf](https://kotlinconf.com/) writing from scratch snake game 
with [ncruses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-intro.html) UI 
using [Kotlin/Native](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native).
You can find slides and source code in [this git repo](https://github.com/dkandalov/kotlin-native-snake).

It's hard for me to know if it's noticeable in the video, but I practiced the live coding part of this talk more than 10 times
with an actual audience (usually, one or two people). This makes it the most prepared talk I've ever done (no implications that it's perfect though).
I'm really grateful to all the people who spent an hour of their life watching me writing snake game.
I updated slides and source code based on their feedback, so the talk won't be the way it is without all of them.
