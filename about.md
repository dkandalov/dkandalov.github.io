Hello, I'm Dmitry.

I have been writing software since [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS) times using various programming languages and technologies.
I spent the last 15 years or so in Java lands and have recently attempted an escape from the banking industry to use [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)
and [Extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) practices.

I often attend tech meetups and other events. Say "hi" if you see me there ðŸ˜€<br/> 
You can find an incomplete list of the conferences I attended in the last few years [on this page](/public-speaking).
 
Feel free to get in touch on [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@dkandalov) or via [email](mailto:dmitry.kandalov@gmail.com).
