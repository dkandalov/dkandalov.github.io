Hi, I'm Dmitry.

I have been writing software since [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS) times using various programming languages and technologies.
I spent the last 20 years or so in Java lands, most "recently" working with server-side Kotlin/Dart/C++
using [Extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) practices.

You can find an incomplete list of the conferences and events I presented at recently [on this page](/public-speaking).
 
Feel free to get in touch on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/dmitrykandalov.bsky.social) or via [email](mailto:dmitry.kandalov@gmail.com).
