This is probably the longest #IntelliJ alt+enter menu I've seen in the wild! (At which point does it become too long? ü§∑)

#### 2024/11/01
I bet everyone knows this but anyway... there is a built-in calculator in #IntelliJ search <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/searching-everywhere.html#calculator> (and in the spotlight search on macOS, and in many other places it seems üôà)

#### 2024/10/30
I like to occasionally check what is going on in the #IntelliJ background tasks (and then hide the popup). While waiting for [IJPL-58948](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-58948) to make it possible with built-in actions, here is a workaround in ~8 lines <https://gist.github.com/dkandalov/d326df86849a2a097d169b781ffbc0a4> #LivePlugin #Kotlin

#### 2024/10/29
It only takes ~5 lines of code to remove editor notification panels in #IntelliJ <https://gist.github.com/dkandalov/3c3984ac39b51883920f019ff91f1351>. Because some panels can only be closed with the mouse (e.g. "Kotlin Scripting is in Beta"). Some cannot be closed at all (e.g. "Decompiled .class file") üôÑ #LivePlugin #Kotlin

#### 2024/10/28
This is likely the oldest (years old) and the most used (by me) #IntelliJ action which I never published. It opens the "IDE Internal Errors" window, so you can move between errors and clear them <https://gist.github.com/dkandalov/0c3a0362d205abd369d363ac280f9d9c> #LivePlugin #Kotlin

This is what Eclipse looks like on macOS these days üòµ I don't think it ever looked polished on Mac, but the 20+ year-old icons make me grateful for #IntelliJ UI evolution (even if it takes effort getting used to a new look and feel every couple of years).

#### 2024/10/23
Fun fact about the Pomodoro plugin for #IntelliJ (which I've supported for nearly 15 years) is that it was originally written for me by a colleague. At the time, I experimented with Pomodoro at work for a few months. A productive day turned out to be ~8 Pomodoros (<4 hours) üò±

#### 2024/10/22
If you haven't heard about the pomodoro technique, it's basically: focus on the task till 25-minute timer stops; if distracted, restart the timer; take breaks. You can try it in #IntelliJ IDEs using [this plugin](https://github.com/dkandalov/pomodoro-tm) (just updated for the latest IDE versions).

=== Reply from [Martin Bonnin](https://x.com/martinbonnin) ===

Man, 25 minutes is the time it takes me to get in the zone üòÖ

=== My reply ===

You can do longer pomodoros! The point is to not be distracted by checking email and social media (during both pomodoro and breaks) üòâ

#### 2024/10/18
There is a #Kotlin intention to convert from member to extension function but not the other way round <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTIJ-12496>. If you're desperate enough, I [hacked the intention](https://github.com/dmcg/gilded-rose-tdd/blob/537de53f9b56b7c173683db0ebb2729def92bcfb/.live-plugins/plugin.kts#L159) (not production quality) for the KotlinConf talk with #LivePlugin. (Also on this topic, why refactoring intentions are not in the refactoring menu? ü§∑)

#### 2024/10/17
I updated my [blog post](https://dmitrykandalov.com/auto-revert) about auto-revert. It made me wonder if there are more fundamental reasons for making large code changes other than lack of skills. Maybe something along the lines of anxiety, imposter syndrome, or boredom.

=== Reply from [Peter Kofler](https://twitter.com/codecopkofler) ===

Broken focus e.g. distractions, interruptions, ADHD. Novelty maybe related to boredom yes

=== Reply from [Ivan ‚ÄúCLOVIS‚Äù Canet](https://twitter.com/ivcanet) ===

That sounds interesting. I wonder if the time should be reset by green tests too.

#### 2024/10/16
Another plugin is off the treadmill of deprecations that throw exceptions in the latest IDE versions üôÑ #IntelliJ plugin to limit your work-in-progress <https://github.com/dkandalov/limited-wip>. It comes with change size watchdog, auto-revert, and TCR mode.

#### 2024/10/15
For the benefit of anyone interested and as a reference for myself, [here are](https://dmitrykandalov.com/intellij-settings) some of the #IntelliJ and related macOS settings I normally use (updated today but not exhaustive). Should I write more about the reasons for all the settings?

#### 2024/10/14
One random takeaway from [SoCraTes Belgium](https://socratesbe.org) is to really try [Last Edit Location](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/navigating-through-the-source-code.html#find_cursor_edit) (cmd+shift+backspace) for #IntelliJ navigation. Although there must be a maximum amount of actively used shortcuts before they take too much brain power and distract you from the actual problem.

=== Reply from [Ted M. Young](https://twitter.com/jitterted) ===

You can always learn one more shortcut! üòÅ

(Just don't ask me what they are, only my fingers know.)

Feel like it'd make a great game to see who knows the most shortcuts!

=== My reply ===

Yes, it's deciding at the moment which shortcut is better that can take energy. My sense is that there is a sweet spot between using *all* possible shortcuts for a particular activity (like navigation) and not knowing/using any.

Maybe as a loose analogy with music, you don't need to play all possible notes.

At the same time, how do you find the sweet spot? And learning new shortcuts until it's clearly too much then to dial down is probably a good strategy.

I wish I could report some useful "AI" features for coding, but they are still too bad at guessing what I'm trying to do. What about variable/function names and noticing name inconsistencies? Matching the code style of the project? Or some other not-too-fancy low-hanging fruit ü§î

#### 2024/10/07
I don't have a habit of using File Structure in #IntelliJ (maybe I need a better keyboard shortcut, sorry cmd/ctrl+F12 üôà), so I just noticed for #Kotlin it shows classes/functions/fields at the class level but only classes/functions and no vars at the function level. Asymmetry!

#### 2024/10/03
Given that #IntelliJ can highlight #Kotlin code with partially invalid syntax or failing type checks, and given that parts of the compiler are used for highlighting, does it mean that partial compilation of Kotlin code is not too hard to implement (at least within IDE)? ü§î

=== Reply from [Martin Bonnin](https://mastodon.social/@mb@mbonnin.net) ===

what would partial compilation do?

=== My reply ===

Compile parts of the source code that can be compiled, and leave the rest to fail at runtime.

This could sometimes be useful during the development cycle. Eclipse Java compiler could do it to some degree. Although it felt a bit weird at the time and I might have shifted since then towards smaller steps to keep all the code compiling, so I can't really say I approve of the approach.

=== Reply from [Martin Bonnin](https://mastodon.social/@mb@mbonnin.net) ===

sounds a bit like JavaScript üòÅ

To be specific about #Kotlin fun interfaces missing usages, I was going to make this [Listener](https://github.com/dkandalov/limited-wip/blob/52871f3a11b1cd853713865e67b44023300e06e7/src/limitedwip/common/vcs/SuccessfulCheckin.kt#L28) `fun` but decided not to because I then won't be able to navigate to its usages, e.g. [here](https://github.com/dkandalov/limited-wip/blob/52871f3a11b1cd853713865e67b44023300e06e7/src/limitedwip/autorevert/components/AutorevertComponent.kt#L56). TLDR language features need properer IDE support.

#### 2024/10/01
Another unfinished #Kotlin feature is find usages of fun interfaces, so code navigation and refactorings suffer. It's 10 years old and in the backlog üò• <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTIJ-2367>

</kotlin>

#### 2024/09/30
One idea for the Activity Tracker plugin is to predict/assist with the next user action based on the project activity history, its current state, etc. Maybe this involves less guessing/variability than predicting the code I'm trying to write.

#### 2024/09/29
South Park Gnomes business plan: 1 - Collect underpants, 2 - ?, 3 - Profit. It was a nonsense joke in 1998 but is very real for some companies today. [Activity Tracker plugin](https://github.com/dkandalov/activity-tracker) (which I just updated to work with the latest #IntelliJ IDEs) is similar except that you own the data. Please help with phase 2!

<img src="../assets/images/micro-blog/2024-09-29.webp" width="80%" height="80%"/>

#### 2024/09/28
I wish there was an option in #IntelliJ to do a text search on the source code of the project libraries. It's already almost there... you can do the search, but you have to select a specific jar file in the project view "External Libraries".

=== Reply from [Anton Keks](https://twitter.com/antonkeks) ===

I think you can do it if you change the Scope in search dialog to Project and Libraries

=== My reply ===

Yes, thank you! Just choosing "Scope" in the "Find in Files" popup window defaults to "All places" which includes all libraries' source code. (It feels like I knew about this feature and discovering it for the third time üôÑ)

#### 2024/09/27
Talking about one change at a time, I don't mean never to do large messy changes. There is a time and place, e.g. making yourself feel better (rationalised as "productive"). Or as an exploration and maybe part of the Mikado method. Just shelve the big change and do it again slowly.

#### 2024/09/26
If there is one piece of advice (aka opinion) I have for developers, it is: Do. One. Thing. At. A. Time. (I'm too bored of seeing code not compiling for a couple of hours and commits that change seemingly everything everywhere.)

=== Reply from [samir, jobless immigrant scum](https://mastodon.functional.computer/@samir) ===

I'd like to add something to this excellent advice.

If you can't do one thing at a time, fix that.

For example, if you can't do one thing at a time because the waiting time to merge is too long (perhaps because you're waiting for a review, or for your build to finish), that's your problem. Figure out how to make it faster until you no longer need to do two things at once.

Oh, it's always a people problem. The build isn't slow because of technology, it's slow because no one cares.

Similarly, you can't make people review in a more timely fashion with more code.

You can't code your way out of the deadline pressure on the engineering team.

Even purely technical solutions need organisational buy-in, or they'll just revert. You can add build caching if you want, but people will just find ways to make it slower.


#### 2024/09/24
With all the money spent on CI/CD tools, how is it that it's still not a common practice to continuously pull non-conflicting changes from upstream into your local code? Similarly, why not auto-push all local changes that passed all tests?

=== Reply from [Oliver Weiler](https://twitter.com/helpermethod) ===

You don't push local changes in the first place because the dev machine may be "tainted" (it works on my machine).

=== My reply ===

If you knew that the dev machine is extremely unlikely to be "tainted" (e.g. it's virtualised), would you continuously push? I suspect most people wouldn't because of deeper (probably behavioural) reasons.

=== Reply from [Oliver Weiler](https://twitter.com/helpermethod) ===

I would never trust a dev machine. I've seen tons of builds break on the CI system because the dev machine had config files / external config / build artifacts not present on the CI system. Impossible to prevent.

=== My reply ===

Sure, ultimately I would not trust any machine or any single build. I've seen build systems being non-deterministic, dirty cache problems, supply chain problems, file system being corrupted, etc. Not many people are being paranoid in this space though.

Overheard at a meetup last week: the top 10 programming languages list is as meaningful as the top 10 bands/artists.

#### 2024/09/16
There is an old idea to treat project file tree with usability in mind. Considering the most common usage patterns (once you know the project), do we really need build files, readme, gitignore, etc. at the project's root? Maybe there should be a convention to hide them a bit.

TIL that GitFlow is not recommended by its author <https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model>.

If you happen to be in London next Thursday (19th September), come say hi at the On #Kotlin meetup <https://www.meetup.com/source-talks-on-kotlin/events/302384401>. The format of six short talks is bound to be great, and it's near a couple of nice north London venues like Never For Ever and The Southampton Arms.

#### 2024/09/11
I occasionally see people coding in #IntelliJ and using Notepad++, VS Code or something else for notes. I wonder if that's because they're not aware of scratches, scratches have discoverability or usability issues, or they have a strong preference for another editor ü§î

#### 2024/09/10
It's one of those days when I'm once again disappointed by IDE not being able to find "implementations" of a typealias in #Kotlin (so I have to resort to find all usages). This is one of the reasons why I think typealiases should only be used within a limited scope (class/file).

#### 2024/09/08
TIL #IntelliJ has an unfinished "Highlight Only Current Declaration" feature (only available in the [internal mode](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/enabling-internal.html)) which greys out code/text outside the current scope. Looks very cool to me ü§© With suppressed inspections, it could be the true distraction-free mode. 

#### 2024/09/06
I know it's too late (and impossible) to fix the "stubs vs mocks vs fakes vs other things" terminology confusion, but I'm tired or stubs which fake an external service and mocks which return values without any checks (especially for data classes in #Kotlin).

#### 2024/09/05
Random #IntelliJ tip (and a reminder for myself). When IntelliJ starts using a lot of CPU and you are about to express your outrage, remember that you can try the "Activity Monitor..." action so the outrage can be expressed in the right direction (or a plugin).

#### 2024/09/02
Good old #Gradle integration in #IntelliJ showing error messages twice <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-221469>. I've definitely seen it before, but I'm probably institutionalised enough to expect strange things from Gradle, and just silently suffered for years.

#### 2024/08/30
#Gradle: "There were failing tests. See report at: file://.../index.html". And of course, it's in the "clouds", so it's a click-ops task to get the file out of it, or the Docker image has been just deleted ü§¨ Maybe printing a test summary to an HTML file is not a good default?

A modified Brian Kernighan quote for the AI hype wave. Debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if a chatbot generated some code for you that you would not be able to write, then how will you ever debug it? With a debugging bot?

It took me only a couple of days to figure out why #LivePlugin compilation stopped working in #Kotlin 1.9 üôà Turns out it was a bug fix, and coincidentally I found a comprehensive list of #Kotlin [language features](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/3a1e8ade670bc33af6084042a0ca73e33e288412/compiler/util/src/org/jetbrains/kotlin/config/LanguageVersionSettings.kt#L267) (which could've saved me couple of days).

Today's puzzler. #Kotlin plugin says smart cast won't work with `invoke` (and suggests a loop of "fixes") but it does. That's because the latest #Kotlin plugin doesn't understand Kotlin 2.0 without (beta) K2 mode üôÑ

val foo = Foo {}

It seems widely recognised that software development is a team effort, but most focus is still on individual people. There are not many stories about software teams (unlike, for example, sports like football). Hiring a team is not really a thing.

#### 2024/08/15
Another example of `invoke()` navigation not fully supported in #Kotlin (including K2) üòø
<kotlin>
interface Foo : (Int) -&gt; String

class Bar : Foo {
    override fun invoke(i: Int) = ""
}

fun main() {
    val foo: Foo = Bar()
    foo(123) // No way to navigate to invoke implementation
}
</kotlin>

=== Reply from [Eduard-Cristian Bolo»ô](https://mastodon.social/@EdyBolos@androiddev.social) ===

This one is so annoying, that I stoped using the invoke operator. I prefer being more vorbose, but have navigation working.

#### 2024/08/13
I wish there were editor/IDE extensions to detect conflicts with other branches or local changes of other developers in real time, i.e. as soon as you type the code. Maybe the lack of these extensions means that people want to be left alone more than doing actual CI ü§î

#### 2024/08/11
Random #IntelliJ tip. You can turn off native file chooser dialog (because IntelliJ dialog is just better) in IDE `Registry` with `ide.mac/win.file.chooser.native` property or in the latest versions in `Advanced Settings` with "Use native file chooser dialog on Windows/macOS" checkbox.

#### 2024/08/10
It's interesting to see more actions (refactoring, code transformations, and settings) in the #IntelliJ alt+enter popup window. Would it eventually include all available actions though? Maybe yes, and similar to the code completion, only with the most relevant actions at the top.

#### 2024/08/09
Random #IntelliJ tip. You can see version control history for selected text by doing alt+enter and choosing "Show history for selection" intention. The functionality existed for years, but I guess it's more discoverable this way and easier than remembering custom shortcuts.

#### 2024/08/08
One thing I'm currently exploring in the #IntelliJ QuickFix plugin is default reordering for intention/inspections. We care about the most relevant auto-completion results to be at the top, so why not have the same for context actions?

#### 2024/08/07
I just uploaded a new version of the QuickFix plugin for #IntelliJ that adds an action to apply the topmost intention/inspection because life is too short to press 'alt+enter, enter' all the time. See üëâ <https://github.com/dkandalov/quick-fix>

#### 2024/08/06
It's probably an unpopular opinion, but having #IntelliJ config files and all dependencies checked into version control was good enough for most projects. I wish there were better tools for downloading/updating dependencies and maybe a build tool (e.g. Amper) to build projects.

Random #IntelliJ tip. There is copy/paste history (ctrl/cmd+shift+V), so you can copy two or more pieces of code from the source file(s), then navigate to the destination and paste from history one by one or several items at once (and it works with multiple cursors too!) üëå

=== Reply from [Oliver Weiler](https://twitter.com/helpermethod) ===

On Mac you can also use <https://maccy.app> to have this functionality everywhere, not only IntelliJ.

=== My reply ===

Thank you! Just tried maccy and it seems like it doesn't paste sometimes üôà Also ¬£10 on App Store but free via brew, not sure what that means ü§î

I like the idea though and can only wonder why it's still not the default functionality of all OS.

BTW, to emphasise the point in IntelliJ you can do multi-select in the copy history and paste all selected items at the same time. For a single cursor, they are concatenated. For multiple, one item is pasted for each cursor.

#### 2024/07/31
#IntelliJ trivia: some shortcuts in the default keyboard layout most likely come from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager#Orthodox_file_managers>, and were probably intended to be intuitive for the users at the time. For example: F4 - edit file, F5 - copy file, F6 - move file, shift+F6 - rename file.

#### 2024/07/28
Someone (maybe a company making software development tools, e.g. [JetBrains](https://twitter.com/jetbrains) üòâ) should do research and design properly ergonomic keyboard shortcuts for code editors. It's tiring to see different and mostly "accidental" shortcuts everywhere.

=== Reply from [breadsmasher](https://mastodon.social/@breadsmasher@lemmy.world) ===

You can literally pick from a list of various different keyboard maps <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html>. [Relevant XKDC](https://xkcd.com/927)

=== My reply ===

Yes, and AFAIK none of them are based on any research or actual design. The XKCD is really valid. Maybe it should be a coordinated attempt by couple popular text editors.

You can't standardise everything, but the basic most common actions could be. There is already a small subset which works across the majority of editors, ctrl/cmd+ZXCV for example.

=== Reply from [breadsmasher](https://mastodon.social/@breadsmasher@lemmy.world) ===

The entire QWERTY layout as far as I remember wasn't based on any design or research

=== Reply from [thisisnotgoingwell](https://mastodon.social/@thisisnotgoingwell@programming.dev) ===

That's wrong. Qwerty was eventually chosen by the inventor because it was the most efficient design. <https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/history-and-evolution-of-qwerty-keyboard>

#### 2024/07/25
I really like the "Unused symbol" inspection in #IntelliJ. Except when it's a bit too random and project-specific ü§∑‚Äç #Kotlin
<kotlin>
val f = 1 // ok
val fo = 1 // unused
val foo = 1 // ok
val fooo = 1 // ok
val foooo = 1 // unused
</kotlin>
None of the above top-level vals are used in the project.

#### 2024/07/24
#Kotlin shows a "declaration has type inferred from a platform call" warning for top-level declarations like this one even though it's not nullable:
<kotlin>
val foo = java.time.Duration.ZERO
</kotlin>
Why not enhance platform types with external annotations (which could be bundled for JDK)?

#### 2024/07/23
It's interesting that some classes in #Kotlin have special treatment for platform types ü§î
<kotlin>
java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference&lt;Int&gt;().set(null) // ok
java.util.Hashtable&lt;Int, Int&gt;().put(null, null) // ok
java.util.ArrayList&lt;Int&gt;().add(null) // doesn't compile
</kotlin>

#### 2024/07/22
There is a nice feature in #IntelliJ to rename variable/function by changing its name and using alt+enter to invoke the 
rename refactoring <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/rename-refactorings.html#inplace_rename>. But it only works on definitions, not usages ü§∑‚Äç So I can't just forget about the rename refactoring shortcut.

#### 2024/07/19
I don't remember if I ever really needed it, but you can have higher-order extension functions in #Kotlin. For example:

<kotlin>
fun f(): Int.() -> Int =
    { this + 1 }

fun main() {
    val extF = f()
    require(42.extF() == 43)
}

If there are extension functions/properties in #Kotlin, should there be extension classes and objects?

=== Reply from [Garth Gilmour](https://twitter.com/GarthGilmour) ===

Do you mean as in Ruby? Would that not require a lot of runtime magic, instead of just compiler sleight of hand?

=== My reply ===

Not like in Ruby because as you say it would be against the grain of Kotlin. But to be clear, I don't know what I mean exactly üôÉ I just take an existing language concept and try applying it more uniformly.

If you think about context parameters (ex "context receivers") as a generalisation of extension functions, then extension classes might be equivalent to context parameters for classes. And I just found an answer here <https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/context-parameters/proposals/context-parameters.md#qa-about-design-decisions> TLDR it's too complex.

=== Reply from [Robert Chatley](https://twitter.com/rchatley) ===

Isn't that called inheritance?

=== My reply ===

I guess the main difference with inheritance is that there is no subtyping ü§î The closest proposed feature for Kotlin is/was [contextual classes](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/context-parameters/proposals/context-receivers.md#contextual-classes-and-contextual-constructors) (And there might be terminology clash between "extends" keyword in Java and "extension" functions in Kotlin.)

One of the interesting discussions at XTC yesterday was "Are backlogs bad?". I like the idea that increasing backlog size needs cost/benefit analysis. Is it about capturing knowledge (e.g. bugs) or is it trying to predict the future? Will it age quickly and become a distraction?

#### 2024/07/16
Interestingly, IntelliJ has an intention for #Kotlin to import object extension functions, but it doesn't work. Could it be a sign of a missing language feature rather than an IDE bug?

<kotlin>
object Foo
fun Foo.bar() = 1

fun main() {
    Foo.bar() // <-- "Add import" does nothing
}

Similar to "stumbling on software design" there often is a gap between what software development seems to be when you start compared to what you end up doing. I bet it's a natural tendency for any discipline, but are there any studies?

There is a difference between what we think, what we say, what we do, how things work out, and how we interpret what happened (and all of these are probably interleaved). It seems that a lot of software design is based on what we say, so this could be an opportunity to improve ü§î

As a reminder for myself that the "right" technology, writing tests first or some magic thing, doesn't guarantee a "good" design. Only making an actual code change later can prove how "good" the design was. Should we speculatively attempt the most likely changes from time to time?

Here is another attempt at paragraph navigation actions (this time mostly based on indentation) <https://gist.github.com/dkandalov/6bd16ac80ee69739f9b81b665bb93768>. Not a very well-factored code as it still doesn't feel right anyway.

#### 2024/07/01
Another random #IntelliJ tip: "Compare With..." action (ctrl/cmd+D) can compare and synchronize folders and compare archive files like .jar and .zip. BTW you can select two or more files with ctrl/cmd+click.

#### 2024/06/30
Random #IntelliJ tip: you can use the "Compare With..." action (ctrl/cmd+D) to compare any two or even three (!) selected files in the project view.

#### 2024/06/29
TIL #IntelliJ "Quick Documentation" action (F1 or ctrl+J) works in the project view and for files it shows file size, creation and modification time. I wish it worked on folders but very useful anyway.

#### 2024/06/28
It seems we are mostly editing code in files as a whole and arranging them in tabs. Could this be different/better? Do you know about any experiments? For example, a "tiled" editor space, where each tile is a projection to a text range corresponding to a field/function/class.

#### 2024/06/27
Following the spatial navigation metaphor in code editors, what should be the third dimension, i.e. moving into and out of the code? üßê My intuition is that moving into is like zooming into function/class definition(s), and out is finding usages, or should it be a folder view?

#### 2024/06/26
Another idea for vertical movement in code editors is to have an "infinite scroll" by showing the "previous" or "next" file, where the order might be the order of files in the project file tree of the editor/IDE.

#### 2024/06/25
Similar to code navigation to the previous/next word being really useful (it should be the default!), it feels like something is missing for moving vertically ü§î Because going up/down one line is too slow, up/down method is too fast, up/down a page is too unstructured.

=== Reply from [Benji Weber](https://twitter.com/benjiweber) ===

Like intellij's `Move Caret Forward/Back a Paragraph` action?

=== My reply ===

Yes, something like that. The problem is that this action, and similar actions in other editors, are about moving to an empty line, not a paragraph (and I don't have a precise definition of what   "paragraph" might mean in the context of a programming language).
Probably some kind of mix with `Move Caret to Code Block End/Start` action could work. Need to experiment more with what feels right for me.

=== Reply from [Stylianos Gakis](https://twitter.com/GakisStylianos) ===

I sometimes use a shortcut to go up to the nearest opening bracket. Another thing I do in big classes is to press F12 I think? And get a list of functions inside the class I am in, and move with arrows to the one I wanna go to.

=== My reply ===

I never got used to navigation to the nearest opening/closing bracket. Probably worth another try! ü§î Yes, file structure (cmd+F12 on mac) is an option and has good usages, but it's more high-level and "breaks" the flow with popup window.

Thinking about it as a uniform navigation in all dimensions (which might not be a good idea btw), I guess it's about finding the analogy for word boundaries and the start/end of the line with vertical navigation.

#### 2024/06/24
Arguably, for code navigation instead of left/right moving to the previous/next character, the default should be previous/next word instead. I have happily used it for years (with an alternative alt+ijkl layout). How is that not a thing in every talk about developer productivity?

=== Reply from [Ted M. Young](https://twitter.com/jitterted) ===

I dunno, but I've seen folks hold down the arrow key to get to the beginning/end of a line instead of using the home/end key (equivalent). I guess it was easier when there was a dedicated key, now maybe folks aren't even aware that there's such a shortcut?

#### 2024/06/23
Here is an updated #Kotlin version of paragraph navigation actions for #IntelliJ <https://gist.github.com/dkandalov/fc8638d21d4ba8b48aec5b25f565c726> (interesting amount of details like scroll to caret, etc.) It still doesn't match my intuition though.

A good example of a web UI jitter is Google search. Search for "123", then search for "1234". Watch All/Images/Videos/... tabs flicker. If logged in, your avatar and Google apps will flicker. If not logged in, "Sign in" jumps left and right. Even in Chrome. Not impressive ü§∑üí∞

It's harder to measure the reduced productivity than the reduced cost of the equipment & support.

Also people who make the decision are not affected as much, so everything might look ok to them.

When every micro-interaction with UI depends on the network latency, it's unlikely to actually work (unless you have wired connection to the server). We won't be aware of every tiny lag but it affects the experience, our behaviour and probably wellbeing. Similar to air quality.

I wonder if there is a good reason #Kotlin doesn't create a class for anonymous objects ü§î

<kotlin>
val config = object {
    val foo = 1
    val bar = 2
}
object Config {
    val foo = 1
    val bar = 2
}
config.foo // doesn't compile
Config.foo // compiles
</kotlin>

=== Reply from [Alejandro Serrano](https://twitter.com/trupill) ===

The problem here is that `config` needs to get a type, and given that the type of the `object` is anonymous, the compiler assigns `Any`. As a result, `foo` and `bar` are not accessible.

=== My reply ===

You're right, what I should've said is why Kotlin doesn't define a named class for top level anonymous objects but does it for local objects (as mentioned by
[pablisco](https://twitter.com/pablisc0)).

=== Reply from [pablisco](https://twitter.com/pablisc0) ===

In fact, given that reassigning a local object var is not supported, it could make sense to deprecate anonymous objects and support local object singletons instead ü§î It may match expectations more closely, IMHO

<kotlin>
var test = object {
    val meh = ""
}
println(test.meh)

test = object { // Type mismatch. Required: ``. Found: ``.
    
}
</kotlin>

=== My reply ===

Ooh, I like the reassignment attempt üòÄ I guess the reassignment of anonymous objects is basically a request for structural types ü§î

Not sure about deprecating anonymous objects though. They are like anonymous classes in Java and are used quite a lot.

To be fair to anonymous objects this works just fine:
<kotlin>
fun main() {
    fun foo() = object {
        val meh = ""
    }
    var test = foo()
    println(test.meh)

    test = foo()
}
</kotlin>

Overthinking power-assert a bit more, maybe it should deliberately limit the complexity of expressions it handles by default. Because tests are also about discovering the design and ways we think about the problem, and without matchers, we might be pushed into pure tech thinking.

#### 2024/05/30
Overthinking power-assert, there will always be expressions too convoluted for diagrams and objects too large or meaningless to render. One extreme could be to save a "debugger view" of relevant objects and show it in IDE on the assertion failure.

#### 2024/05/12
I still miss Java `static` in #Kotlin to indicate that the function doesn't use class fields. Companion objects are a bit too indented, and moving the function out of the class distorts the "ownership." So I think I mostly just leave these functions in the class ü§î

An old bugbear of mine is the Gradle test runner in #IntelliJ that doesn't run disabled tests. Classic JUnit runner can do it, so it looks like a regression bug to me (probably >10 years old). Things like that make me doubt Gradle should be the default way to build projects.

I understand that all people are different and there is neurodiversity, but I struggle to understand how people don't notice lots of (squiggly yellow) warnings in the editor. Or reversing the question, why am I so bothered by them? ü§î

=== Reply from [G√∂rge](https://mastodon.social/@goerge@social.devteams.at) ===

I believe, that a lot of people are overwhelmed of the possibilities and visual clues of an IDE. So maybe it's just selective perception so that don't "see" the warnings. Maybe it's also a matter of education. "They" just don't know that the warnings are there to help.

To the reverse question: Same here. I did learn it the hard way. From the C/C++ Compiler warnings over the first hints in JBuilder and later eclipse to the rich code flow analysis based IDEA hint. It makes me a better programmer if I read and understand the warnings.
As we're taking care of our coworkers, we want them to learn, too.

It might be a false memory, but I think it was possible in #IntelliJ to configure the build so that it doesn't open a tool window every time compilation fails. I wonder what happened to it ü§î

Isn't that in the run configuration settings? IIRC you can decide whether the view opens or not

Yes, there is a setting in the run config, but that's for running, not building. So if there is a compilation error, #IntelliJ opens Build tool window regardless of the run config.

At the same time, it's always a trade-off, and if creating an API is impossible without a degraded experience for some users, then it might be worth it anyway. I wonder if it is (was) the case for C++ STL for example üßê 

#### 2024/04/25
Yet another example of #Kotlin APIs interacting with IDE support is that you can't easily find subtypes of type aliases or function types. Not a massive deal on its own (unless you really need it), but these things can accumulate.
<kotlin>
typealias Foo = () -> Int
object MyFoo : Foo {...}
</kotlin>

=== Reply from [Uberto Barbini](https://twitter.com/ramtop) ===

this is big peeve of mine! I like typealiases but their usage are hard to find.
My #1 feature for IntelliJ would be a Hoogle-like api search engine where you can put a signature and get all functions with that signature (or places where they are needed)

#### 2024/04/24
Another example of #Kotlin APIs affected by IDE is type aliases support. In the code below, the "Specify return type explicitly" intention expands the alias instead of using `Foo` (it works with simple aliases though).
<kotlin>
typealias Foo = () -&gt; Int
fun bar(foo: Foo): () -&gt; Int = foo
</kotlin>

#### 2024/04/23
Another example of #Kotlin APIs affected by IDE is unusably slow "Find/Show Usages" on widely used functions (with short names maybe ü§î). I've seen it happening with `from()` and `invoke()`. Not great for classes extending function types. (Sorry, can't find the right YouTrack issue.)

#### 2024/04/22
One example of #Kotlin API usability affected by IDE is the navigation of the `invoke()` function. In the code below, you can only "Jump To Source" (or ctrl+click) on the last closing paren.

<kotlin>
class Foo: (Int) -&gt; Unit {
    override fun invoke(n: Int) {}
}
Foo()(n = 123)
</kotlin>

It's a great library and especially useful when you need to select a format dynamically, via HTTP content negotiation or version info within a file, for example. Which, given enough time, is always.

One way to make `(Auto)Closable` in Java/Kotlin safer could be a compiler check that it's been closed. Something similar to `@Nullable`/`@NotNull` annotation or <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-12719>. (To be fair, there is a Java inspection for `AutoClosable` in IntelliJ, but this is not generic enough.)

How would that be possible to track? I use a DSL for that, I released it as a 1 file library in Arrow.
Hmm, KDoc missing from Dokka. <https://apidocs.arrow-kt.io/arrow-autoclose/arrow/-auto-close-scope/index.html>
1st party support would be cool though.

=== My reply ===

For Kotlin, the same (or similar) way IntelliJ finds unused `Deferred`. Just for reference `DeferredResultUnusedInspection` [source code](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/b45abaca53c20b199c70365aad548150b6ea5e7a/plugins/kotlin/idea/src/org/jetbrains/kotlin/idea/inspections/coroutines/DeferredResultUnusedInspection.kt#L17) and `AbstractResultUnusedChecker` is easy to configure.

Why JDK has `(Auto)Closable` interfaces but nothing like `Disposable` (e.g. see <https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/idea/222.3739.54/platform/util/src/com/intellij/openapi/Disposable.java>; not to be confused with `IDisposable` in C#) or similar pattern to pass the parent resource owner as a parameter so that it's harder to forget to close the `Closable`? üßê

I haven't looked at it deeply, but it seems like the official sdk might obsfucate the end client from you, thus rendering it untestable in a non-in-memory fashion? The Java SDK did allow for replacement of the http client so you could decorate it with observability etc..

As an example of why bother with allocation stack traces, imagine seeing this line in #Kotlin stack trace FooKt$compose$1.invoke(foo.kt:42). With many usages of compose() in the project, it can be hard to find the right one and the functions it composed (and so on recursively).

Unlikely to be a new idea, but it could be useful to have object allocation stack traces in a debugger. Then the allocation stack traces might include objects that also have allocation stack traces... and that's almost profiling ü§î #whynot

It's not already like that? I mean you need to qualify it for refer to the other receivers

You're right, `this` can only refer to immediate receiver or has to be qualified üò≥ What I mean is accessing several contexts via implicit `this`

The usability of APIs is not just typing the right code. It's also the amount of friction or help from the compiler/IDE/editor at every step, being able to "guess" the right thing to do, navigating to and understanding the source code, finding documentation/examples online, etc.

#### 2024/04/02
I wish there was more usability testing on APIs. Nothing fancy. Just watch someone with good knowledge of the programming language and technology complete a couple of tasks (no hints, no judgment).

I almost never use run, or with. I rarely use also, typically for (temp) logging.

let I also use sparingly, for ?.let(::Reference) and similar but definitely not always.

So I refrain from these most of the time.

I use with only when I need something in scope to get ext functions on something else.

Run is nice sometimes as a let on receiver, but the name is unfortunate

#### 2024/03/25
Nothing radically new here, but in #Kotlin you can change the order of function/constructor calls in the code to match the execution order with scope or extension functions. For example:

println(qix(bar(foo(123))))

foo(123).let(::bar).let(::qix).also(::println)

Here are some old ideas to make coding interviews more fair. Do an actual pair programming session, in which nobody knows the problem or solution. Do it on a "neutral" territory. No hard time limit. In big companies randomly interview existing employees to measure the baseline.

The obvious principle behind that: Being a good candidat should be a second job <https://dev.to/jmfayard/how-to-not-answer-where-do-you-see-yourself-in-5-years-398m>


> Being a good candidate should not be a second job.
Remember back of the day where we didn't care much about usuability. We had our software, it was not perfect but it worked. Users complained that it was hard to use. From our side we complained that they were too lazy to RTFM.
> Thing went on and on, and then we realized that the user is not trained or paid to use our software.
> We are the professional and it's our job to think about usability and make sure we understand the user so much that we will remove the obstacles on her path before she can see it.
> <br/>
> The same principle holds in a job interview.
> The candidate is neither trained nor paid to be a good candidate.
> Her real job is to be a good developer, and that's what the interview should be all about.
> The interviewer is the professional, he is paid for that, he can prepare things in advance. That's his job to think about what makes candidates uncomfortable for no value to the company. And get those obstacles out of the way.


=== Reply from [Dave H](https://twitter.com/thinkfoo) ===

I like the idea. Choosing that neutral territory again and again could be tricky though.

A benefit for the interviewee of working on the companies actual codebase is it's an opportunity for them to learn if the organisations code is an environment they want to work in

Do both?

=== My reply ===

This is a good point. It's easy to run out of neutral spaces even in a big city. Might still be worth it compared to a corporate environment where you can't walk on your own and need a "permission" to drink water or go to the toilet.

Yes! Working on a real codebase is another good idea üôÇ Maybe even pay for it.

This idea does not scale. Imagine how many new tasks covering the required set of skills you need to craft in medium-large companies?

Good coding interviews already resemble pair programming. Yes, interviewer done that task dozens of times, but that advantage can be neutralized by selecting everyday tasks as interview tasks.

If you hire a backend dev, make them do a CRUD app with some specific of your domain. They've too done cruds dozens if not hundreds of times. So the fact that interviewer done this particular task shouldn't matter.

=== My reply ===

I suspect that interviewers who are very familiar with the problem can be affected by [attribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_bias) and [self-serving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias) biases. And since knowing about the bias doesn't make you less biased, something else needs to change.

To be fair, in #IntelliJ it's easy to write a naive expansion to word boundaries (see attached snippet for LivePlugin). What's hard is to make it work in all contexts with other selection expansion handlers (it doesn't). And given enough users, someone will always be upset üëç

I thought plain text #IntelliJ selection expansion first selects "valid id", then text surrounded by spaces, then wider context.

The rabbit hole of the day is exploring selection expansion in different editors, e.g.

I wish there was also this selection:
<plain-text>
foo [a=a|aa] bar

Thinking of too many #Gradle downloads (because of many minor versions), the most appealing solution is to make core Gradle smaller and "finish" it, so it will naturally need fewer releases. And, hopefully, less API churn, so the build scripts from five years ago are valid today.

That's the whole point of the Gradle wrapper (and Maven wrapper if you're using it), allowing for completely reproducible builds.

Yes, reproducible builds are non-negotiable. The question is if the experience could be better :) I agree about disk space, although it's funny downloading +100Mb to compile a few classes. It's the download time (opening an old project on a train), IntelliJ indexing, etc.

Random #IntelliJ/#Gradle tip to balance out the rants. You can assign a keyboard shortcut to the "Execute Gradle Task" action (I have it as cmd+shift+G, G for Gradle). The action has auto-completion and hints for all Gradle tasks and flags! üòå

Unpopular opinion, but I'm still not convinced by #Kotlin in #Gradle builds. It's slower. IntelliJ occasionally makes the whole script red. Build scripts are more verifiable with Kotlin but not more comprehensible. It's still a matter of copying random snippets from the Internet üò¨üôà

Thinking about code coverage, maybe instead of a separate feature, it should be the default behaviour when running tests (definitely during the development cycle) üßê There will be performance overhead, but it might be ok for many projects since the build is already super-slow üôà

=== Reply from [Eugen Martynov](https://twitter.com/jack_martynov) (redacted) ===

So the case is about teams that collect coverage only. Frankly speaking, I know tons of people who write tests after code, so for them it is kinda obvious. As another reminder to write tests, maybe. Recently, I saw rare cases for projects without tests. Pet projects have tests.

=== My reply (redacted) ===

I would say not collecting but actually seeing in IDE which lines have coverage. This can be useful for both test-first and test-after.
Yes, sometimes it feels obvious which lines are executed and then the reality surprises me üòµ‚Äçüí´

I never found collecting code coverage super-useful, but maybe I haven't seen it used right.

While I remember, here is an old video by [@sandromancuso](https://twitter.com/sandromancuso) showing how code coverage can be used during development <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NnElPO5BU0>.


#### 2024/02/14
#IntelliJ has a popup window with recent run/debug "configurations" (alt+shift+F9 or F10). This is really cool and makes at least part of the top panel obsolete once you know the shortcuts. But there seems to be nothing similar for running with code coverage and profiler ü§®

#### 2024/02/13
Another idea is to bring the auto-completion of "object." from class-oriented to functional code. For example, when using http4k if I type `Request(` maybe #IntelliJ could show a dropdown with the values of the Method enum because it's the only possible first parameter ü§î #Kotlin

#### 2024/02/12
I wonder if it might be a useful feature to have import "affinity" so that if there are few imports in a file from a particular package, more things are auto-imported from the package. Or maybe it already exists? (Please don't suggest auto-import exclusions in #IntelliJ üôÉ)

#### 2024/02/11

One of the coolest features in #IntelliJ 2024 for me are the charts üí™üìà I guess they work on any "data" content, but CSV file support is the killer feature because they are so easy to produce in a few lines of code.

Turns out #Kotlin get/set operators can have multiple parameters of any type üßê For example:
<kotlin>
operator fun &lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt;.get(i: Int, f: () -&gt; Int): List&lt;T&gt; = ...
operator fun &lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt;.get(vararg indices: Int): List&lt;T&gt; = ...

Which can be used like this:
<kotlin>
list[0, { 123 }]
list[0, 2, 4]

A bit of a boring topic, but it seems there is a tendency to extract a CONSTANT whenever there is a "special" value in the code. I would prefer a local variable just because it's in line with making definitions as private as possible. I wonder if there is a CONSTANT_CARGO_CULT? üßê

I doubt it's a new idea, but why not make #Twitter features into Internet standards (instead of another social network)? For example, a tweet could be content with URI, reply - a relation to another URL, following - something similar to RSS, likes - a generic rating system, etc.

#### 2024/01/27
One lesson I learned from the Twitter takeover is that if I care about the content I publish on social networks, I shouldn't rely on them to keep it or make it available.

Having approval/snapshot tests for calculated cells in notebooks could be really useful. The hardest part is to show meaningful diffs for complex and visual data.

If #Java/#Kotlin libraries, ideally, shouldn't have global side effects (e.g., print to stdout or create a global thread pool), then maybe they should also avoid logging via global API. And instead, configure logger as a function (or object) explicitly passed into library API ü§î

Random #IntelliJ tip. If you see a yellow/red notification panel at the top of the editor with some actions as links, instead of using the mouse to click the links, you can trigger the actions via the alt+enter popup window. For example, "Setup SDK" in the screenshot below.

Premature optimisation or prudent code avoiding `Iterator` allocation?

=== Reply from [Brian Ziman](https://mastodon.social/@BrianZiman) ===

Definitely a premature optimization. ArrayList doesn't allocate an iterator at all, nor does Guava's ImmutableList. I would guess most "good" classes have a pretty optimized forEach() method. If you're relying on the default implementation of Iterable.forEach() in some other less performant type, then this trivial optimization probably doesn't buy you anything at all, but costs you readability.

#### 2024/01/22
Pedantic alert ü§ìüö® Are there any docs saying that #Kotlin `val` actually means "value"? It's "local property" in [the language spec](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/declarations.html#local-property-declaration). "Property" in [the grammar](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/grammar.html#propertyDeclaration). And "read-only local variable" in [the documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html#variables).

#### 2024/01/20
I did the NO_SCREAMING_SNAKE_CONSTANTS lightning talk at the last XTC meetup. An interesting observation is that with the same style, it's easier to change `val`s to `const`s or back without updating all usages. And a suggestion to try uppercase for vars and mutable data instead üòØ

#### 2024/01/19
Programming language terminology is a mess. People say "variable" meaning unmodifiable reference to immutable data, e.g. String `val` in #Kotlin. üôà Or it can be a modifiable reference to mutable data. How new joiners are supposed to make sense of this? ü§∑‚Äç We need better terms!

#### 2024/01/18
I did a small write up suggesting to inline all single usage "variables" in #Kotlin <https://dmitrykandalov.com/tidy-kotlin#inline-variables-with-single-usage> because there are pretty much no downsides to that (except if it needs a better name or object requires longer lifetime obviously).

Another interesting historical speculation is that the camelCase naming style became popular because of the lack of an underscore key on some of the old keyboards <http://exampler.com/blog/2012/05/15/speculation-about-the-origin-of-camelcase>. Surprisingly, there aren't many studies to know if camelCase is better or worse for reading identifiers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case#Readability_studies>.

I wonder if making variables/functions/classes/etc. as private as possible is considered to be a form of encapsulation. Or "encapsulation" is too specific to OO and something like "information hiding" is better for non-OO code?

=== Reply from [Orchun Kolcu](https://mastodon.social/@orchun@hachyderm.io) ===

I don't think encapsulation is OO specific (and although people will argue otherwise, information hiding is just what you achieve by encapsulating decisions), but there needs to be a capsule/abstraction you can point to as the end result.

So maybe outside that context, it's just minimizing visibility or "hidden by default".

I find "code smell" as a metaphor quite descriptive. Like smells, it's often an immediate uncontrolled reaction, and I can be rigid about preferences. I wish though I could be more flexible and absorb the context in which the code was written. Maybe another metaphor could help? ü§î

[KT-17206](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-17206) NoSuchMethodError happens with dependencies SomeTest->SomeClass->Util, where Util from test shadows Util from main. The same issue exists in Java, but in #Kotlin it's easier to forget that files are always classes. And it's compounded by tools not showing classpath üòî This must be even more confusing for #Kotlin multiplatform when not targeting JVM #leakyabstraction

#### 2024/01/04
To be specific about [KT-17206](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-17206), extract a couple of test functions into Util.kt. #IntelliJ is happy. #Kotlin compiles the code. But when running tests, they fail with NoSuchMethodError. The reason is that there is already UtilKt class in the main code. See <https://github.com/dkandalov/hello-KT-17206/blob/main/src/test/kotlin/test/SomeTest.kt>

It's one of those days when after making a trivial change, I get a baffling NoSuchMethodError.

Not a new idea, but I wonder if the web (similar to how we browse code) could be more about structured data and less about styles. It might be too late for HTML, but what if browsers rendered markdown ü§î This also solves the light/dark mode "problem" with local rendering.

#### 2023/12/30
Similar to how we might see ads on websites, maybe we could have "ads" in codebases showing links to related code or well-known bugs/pitfalls/etc related to the code on the screen. Like inspections in #IntelliJ but less focused on the specific line of code üßê

#### 2023/12/28
To be clear, when I suggest tracking user navigation on codebases, it's not just about improving the IDE/editor experience, but about improving the code (or how we think about it) in the context of the current project and people. Or at least learning about it based on data.

#### 2023/12/27
It would be great to have use cases for tracking user navigation on codebases. If you're using #IntelliJ-based IDE on a project big enough to benefit from usage/navigation tracking, please let me know, and I might tweak this plugin <https://github.com/dkandalov/activity-tracker> so that it works well for your project.

#### 2023/12/26
Another application of web browsing to codebases might be to track user navigation. If you know the most viewed areas, common navigation patterns, etc., then you can improve the areas that matter. Or maybe discover that some people have tacit knowledge that's worth sharing.

#### 2023/12/24
Given browsing is like a code navigation analogy, browsers could also borrow a few things from IDEs/editors. For example, the old idea of a website map, i.e. a tree structure for navigation. Or why we still can't bookmark any line on a website? ü§∑

#### 2023/12/23
We browse websites with their original styling (ignoring Safari reader view and Opera local CSS since they're not too popular.) At the same time, codebases don't have any styling at all. What if they did, so we could see the code exactly the same way as authors?

#### 2023/12/22
Continuing with code navigation is similar to the web browsing analogy, all browsers have navigation history sorted by time, which you can also search and filter. Why is it not a norm for text editors/IDEs? üßê

Discovered today a great talk by [@emeryberger](https://mastodon.social/@emeryberger@discuss.systems) "Performance Matters" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-TLSBdHe1A> TLDR it's easy to misattribute performance changes due to memory layout, etc. Profilers are not designed for concurrency.

#### 2023/12/20
I don't think there is an action in #IntelliJ to open a declaration in a new split on the right. Using macro (Edit Source, Move Tab Right) works but has too much visual noise. OTOH, there is an underrated (thinking about myself) "Show Type Definition" action that shows a popup.

#### 2023/12/19
Another application of "code navigation is like browsing" is for IDEs/editors and web browsers to learn from each other. For example, Arc browser on alt+click opens a link in a new right split. Unlike VS Code which on alt+cmd+click keeps only one right split. Why the difference?

#### 2023/12/18
If you agree with the analogy between navigating a codebase and browsing websites, then learning from web usability to apply it to software design would make sense. For example, "Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Krug is an old but good book on the topic <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited>

#### 2023/12/17
I wonder if "reading" code is a good analogy for any large enough codebase (and, if not, it might be leading us in the wrong direction). Yes, we read words on the screen, but overall it's closer to browsing the Internet than reading a book ü§î "Navigability" vs "readability"?

=== Reply from [Estrella Kowalski](https://twitter.com/kowalski17324) ===

I think it's a good analogy. Code is a form of written communication, and reading it is a way to understand it.

=== My reply ===

Yes, it's definitely reading because most programs are text-based. And it's also a different kind of reading, e.g. compared to books one difference is that it's not sequential. "I was reading the Internet" sounds odd, so maybe there could be a term for "reading" codebases.

Fundamentally, #Kotlin coroutines is compiler transforming code into a state machine. They are in stdlib, e.g. Sequence builder. Nothing to do with async. And there are async coroutines in kotlinx.coroutines built on top. Both are "coroutines". Obviously, not so obvious.

I wish #Kotlin stdlib had Flow-like API with onStart/onComplete/catch/etc. for Sequence/Iterable. And maybe cancellation by making them AutoClosable (?) üôàü§î (I'm sure there are some good discussions on youtrack, slack and Kotlin forum.)

Pretty bad, because context preservation breaks with EmptyCC.

Another idea is to have more terms than just "tech debt." For example, distinguish it from "tech underinvestment" as suggested by [@natpryce](https://mastodon.social/@natpryce). Maybe a separate term for code ageing, when code becomes obsolete because of programming language and technology changes.

#### 2023/11/19
It's unfortunate that "technical debt" is the only widespread term we have. Maybe "technical shortcuts" is a bit more descriptive and less metaphorical ü§î I also like a bit more opinionated "unsuitable code" by [@lukesleeman](https://mastodon.social/@lukesleeman@aus.social).

#### 2023/11/18
Another deceitful metaphor is technical debt. The problem is that it implies the predictability of debt. In practice, it's often a trap with no clear way out (like piling up pieces in Tetris). Compounded by the sunken cost fallacy, the "debt" is even less likely to be untangled.

Somewhat surprisingly, the "unimportant implementation details" like using "eventually {...}" in tests can have a cascading effect via slow CI/deployment on software design, people behaviour, and organisation overall. Similarly, a slow compiler/IDE is never about time.

#### 2023/11/09
Another possible side effect of slow CI/deployment is over engineering. Some of it is a rational response to not being able to fix things quickly. Some, I suspect, is keeping yourself entertained which is then post-rationalised to be necessary.

#### 2023/11/07
Working in an environment with slow CI/deployment, it's not impossible to be upset when someone breaks deployed software and it takes hours to fix. So, if you're not careful, this creates peer pressure on the team, and maybe you get a bit of pressure from yourself.

#### 2023/11/06
Slow CI builds increase the time it takes to fix things after deployment. At the same time, larger code changes (encouraged by slow CI) are more likely to have problems. That creates a higher stake environment in which you really don't want to make a mistake üòì

#### 2023/11/05
The problem with slow CI is not just the time it takes but also the behaviours it encourages. Waiting a couple of hours for a minor change seems like a waste, so it's tempting to batch up a few changes or do something else in parallel, which increases work-in-progress.

#### 2023/11/04
Overall, `eventually {...}` in tests is a code smell, similar to `delay(5.seconds)` waiting for the clock to move forward. There are ways to avoid it, and it's ultimately your choice. Continuous integration is not supposed to be "continuous" because the build takes 24 hours.

#### 2023/11/03
To be fair to projects with `eventually {...}` in tests, it can be hard to control concurrency or change design with tech decisions made a while ago and the code tied to a framework that does its own thing. You just end up copy-pasting `eventually` in the name of consistency üòø

#### 2023/11/02
There is no magic avoiding `eventually {...}` in tests. The basic answer is to have control over concurrency (like controlling time with the Clock). If it's the code you can modify, then change its design. If it's an external technology, wrap it in a minimal API and use a fake.

#### 2023/11/01
Another problem with `eventually {...}` is that it's easy to sprinkle tests with it but can be really hard to remove because the design won't let you control concurrency and it's hard to refactor with the build being slow and flaky. It's a trap! üòí #testing #rant

#### 2023/10/31
The reason why using `eventually {...}` in tests is not a good idea is that it will make your build slow and non-deterministic. Retries will slow down passing tests, timeouts will make failures even slower, and failure messages will read like "something didn't happen on time" ü§∑

#### 2023/10/30
If you use something like `eventually {...}` function all over the tests (which retries with timeout the lambda until it succeeds), the chances are you're doing it wrong. Ideally, refactor concurrency you're waiting for out of the core logic and test concurrent things separately.

#### 2023/10/29
To be clear, I suggest projectional editor for #Kotlin/#Java not just for formatting, but for overall code layout and how we experience working with codebases. For example, "navigation" could show functions next to each other, or maybe hide private fields or some "obvious" types.

#### 2023/10/27
Since it's nearly impossible to "win" any code style/formatting argument, could we have a projectional editor for #Kotlin/#Java, e.g. as an IntelliJ plugin please. It has to be clever though to project into the "current code style" in text format üßê

#### 2023/10/26
I wonder how much code layout (let's say just within a file) affects how we think about programs. Is there any research? ü§îüî¨ What if changing the layout could shift overall project design to be less data centric for example?

#### 2023/10/25
Thinking about details first/last in #Kotlin classes, the default style is neither. It seems to be guided by object initialisation and execution order (init fields, invoke constructor, public/private functions). As a reader you're supposed to play the role of a computer I guess ü§∑

#### 2023/10/24
Timeless question: define details first or last? In particular, in a #Kotlin file should data classes used in an interface be defined before or after the interface? If details last, then shouldn't all fields/properties be at the bottom of the class? Do you, should you care?

Most important thing first. Probably not quite right, I like to _think_ of it as similar to writing's "inverted pyramid" ‚Äî

This is a somewhat obvious thing to say but if you use randomly generated objects in tests, you really need to have a seed. Otherwise, it's a lot of fun with not very reproducible failures and builds. Also don't assume that two random values are not equal üôà

#### 2023/10/22
Thinking about namespace pollution in #Kotlin via extension functions, is `fun¬†Iterable<T>.foldResult()¬†{...}` a good idea? The problem is that `foldResult` will appear in the auto-completion list for any Iterable even if it's not using Result type ü§î [https://github.com/fork-handles/...iterables.kt](https://github.com/fork-handles/forkhandles/blob/d3dae418025d737cf91ae589e284c6ae48ea9e0c/result4k/core/src/main/kotlin/dev/forkhandles/result4k/iterables.kt#L30)

#### 2023/10/20
In #kotest tests are just functions. So they can be extracted into other extension functions like this:
<kotlin>
fun FunSpec.someTests() {
    test("1") {...}
    test("2") {...}
}
</kotlin>

Clever but the problem is that you can't run just one test from IDE üòí Use abstract class instead? #UXfail

#### 2023/10/19
Back to #kotest rants. Because kotest has "built in coroutine support at every level" when an assertion fails, you can't navigate to the matcher source code from the stack trace (Kotlin coroutines are stackless). So good luck if the error message is not very clear.

=== Reply from [James Ward](https://twitter.com/_JamesWard) ===

I wonder if Stacktrace Recovery could help:
<https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/docs/topics/debugging.md#stacktrace-recovery>

#### 2023/10/18
Random #IntelliJ tip. You can select multiple items in lists/trees and apply action to all of them. E.g. select files in project view, press enter and all selected files will be open. The same works with find/show usages. Or abstract function can be implemented on all classes by using "select all" via ctrl/cmd+A, then "enter" üëå

#### 2023/10/17
The reason lambda flavours in #Kotlin could be useful (e.g. with different/combined background colour in IDE) is that the meaning of indentation is diluted by "boring" let/apply/..., parameters on separate lines, nested functions, etc. Also .map() on collections vs Result type üòµ

#### 2023/10/16
I wonder if #Kotlin contracts could capture lambda flavours and maybe visualise them in IDE ü§î E.g. `let` runs lambda once, `?.let` maybe once, `forEach` many times, `executor.submit{}` runs on a different thread later. (Also haven't heard much about contracts for a while.)

#### 2023/10/15
To be fair, with `?:` extracted into a function and using `let` with reference is an interesting alternative to if/else. Thanks to [@natpryce](https://mastodon.social/@natpryce) for suggestion.

<kotlin>
fun Int?.toJson(): JsonNode =
    this?.let(::IntNode).orNullNode()

fun JsonNode?.orNullNode(): JsonNode =
    this ?: NullNode.instance
</kotlin>

=== Reply from [@natpryce](https://mastodon.social/@natpryce) ===

Nice. And to avoid duplicating logic, you could define:

<kotlin>
fun &lt;T : Any&gt; T?.toJson(toNode: (T) -&gt; JsonNode): JsonNode =
    this?.let(toNode).orNullNode()
</kotlin>

And then define:
<kotlin>
fun Int?.toJson() = toJson(::IntNode)
‚Ä¶ etc ‚Ä¶
</kotlin>

#### 2023/10/14
Which of these Kotlin one-liners do you prefer?
<kotlin>
fun Int?.toJson() = if (this != null) IntNode(this) else NullNode.instance
</kotlin>
or
<kotlin>
fun Int?.toJson() = this?.let { IntNode(it) } ?: NullNode.instance
</kotlin>

I'm in favour of if/else, `?.let` is overrated and can be against the "grain" of Kotlin üò¨üôà

Would you rather have a feature/tool which depends on some non-public API (and can break in the future without notice) or not have the feature/tool at all? I'd choose the first option. Also in my experience some public APIs end up as volatile as internal ones ü§∑ü§î

#### 2023/10/10
#IntelliJ tip for #Kotlin. You can search for class default constructor (instead of class usages) by positioning cursor before the paren "(". Like this `class Foo|(val n: Int)` and invoke "Show Usages" action. I found it by chance. Wish it was more discoverable though üßê

#### 2023/10/07
What about namespace "pollution" by extension functions in #Kotlin? E.g. a library with `fun¬†Any?.print()` (yes, it's a #kotest #rant again) will add `print()` to code completion popup for all objects. Sure, IDE can deprioritise it, but maybe don't do it in the first place?

#### 2023/10/06
More #kotest #rants... `shouldHaveSize()` is helpful enough to print the whole (actual) list when sizes don't match. Good idea unless the list contains large data classes. Good luck scrolling around Gradle output for the failure message. OTOH, it could be symptom of a bad test ü§î

#### 2023/10/05
Another #kotest #rant is that most of its matchers don't show diff window in IntelliJ with JUnit5 runner. It tries but most matchers throw `AssertionError` (no diff) and some `AssertionFailedError` (has diff) ü§∑üòí Makes you wonder if kotest authors actually use it via IntelliJ.

#### 2023/10/04
Kotest has `eventually()` function which retries lambda until it succeeds or times out. Not the best idea to use it across all tests in the first place, but in addition kotest prints stack trace from the first and the last failure, so you end up scrolling down ü§¶‚Äç #kotest #rant

#### 2023/10/03
Thinking about comments I'm definitely in the camp of avoiding comments in the code unless it's really necessary. It's better to have a good variable/function name or a test case to explain a subtle detail. This includes test case names which look like wordy comments üôà

#### 2023/10/02
If you care about how the source code is formatted, how variables/functions/etc. are named, then it might be worth caring as much about comments. Re-read them after writing, use spell checker and maybe start comments with a capital letter (as if it was a sentence because it is)?

#### 2023/10/01
Another interesting idea is to have stack traces with granularity down to expression/statement instead of just line number. They might need to be aware of the testing library to trace creation of matchers, etc. Not easy to implement for #Kotlin on the JVM and even harder for Kotlin multiplatform üôà

#### 2023/09/30
In many environments where we run tests (locally, CI pipelines) we have access to the source code. When a test fails, why not use it to show code of the failed line/paragraph before the failure message? ü§î

As couple people have pointed out there is <https://github.com/laech/java-stacksrc>. I haven't tried it yet, but it looks promising.

#### 2023/09/28
Most assertion libraries (in #Kotlin and other languages) reimplement language features (not, or, and, equals etc) 
and standard library (contains, isEmpty, etc). I wish there was more effort to make tools like 
<https://github.com/bnorm/kotlin-power-assert> work really well.

#### 2023/09/27
To be fair, the previous example could use matcher composition where beSuccess() is not an expression 
(it will be type-safe with #Kotlin contracts). Thanks to [@sf105](https://mastodon.social/@sf105@mastodonapp.uk) for pointing that out.
<kotlin>
val items = listOf(...)
storage.upload(items) should beSuccess()
storage.listAll() should (beSuccess() and equalTo(items))
</kotlin>

#### 2023/09/26
A better example of `Result.expectSuccess()` used as an expression. 
If Result is treated like checked exception, it should be ok to handle it in any part of the test ü§î
<kotlin>
val items = listOf(...)
storage.upload(items).expectSuccess()
storage.listAll().expectSuccess() shouldEqual items
</kotlin>

#### 2023/09/25
Thinking about the example with `Result.expectSuccess()` a bit more complete test might look like this:
<kotlin>
val expected = random&lt;Foo&gt;()
val actual = Foo.parse(expected.toJson()).expectSuccess()
actual equalTo expected
</kotlin>
Which pushes one of the assertions into the "when" step ü§î

#### 2023/09/24
I wish more #Kotlin assertion libraries had assertion functions as expressions so that they could be chained. For example:
<kotlin>
result.expectSuccess() equalTo 123
httpResponse.expectStatus(OK).body.equalTo("{some json}")
</kotlin>

Random #IntelliJ tip. There is "Show Gradle Daemons" action which shows daemons with pid, status, etc. and lets you stop them. It's not in any menu, but you can invoke it via "Find Action" (cmd+shift+A or ctrl+shift+A). As with most tips it's probably a UX failure... I mean an opportunity for improvement üôà

Here is another basic function I wish was in #Kotlin stdlib
<kotlin>

This is really just `?.let` but I think `ifNotNull` follows the Kotlin way by being more explicit.

#### 2023/09/19
Not many people consider this but CONSTANTS DON'T NEED TO BE UPPERCASE. They're not the most important thing in the code and don't need the emphasis (e.g. unlike mutable global variables). The convention dates back to the early days of C and the need to distinguish symbolic constants defined as macros from variables üëâ <https://accu.org/journals/overload/22/121/wakely_1923> It's never too late to stop the cargo cult! Can we have it in #Kotlin 2.0 please? üòÖ

#### 2023/09/18
One of the basic functions I wish was in #Kotlin stdlib (originally by Duncan McGregor)
<kotlin>
fun &lt;T&gt; T.printed(): T = apply { println(this) }

So you can do `foo.update().printed()` without extracting a variable and using a separate line for println().
