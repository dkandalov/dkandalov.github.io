Rick Beato has a great [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RickBeato). In particular, "What Makes This Song Great?" videos, e.g. [Metallica - ‚ÄúMaster of Puppets‚Äù Breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EOHKfoDyrI). I'm wondering if there is something similar for #software analysing/appreciating/criticising well-known projects. Should John Carmack or Dave Farley do it? üòÖ

Does the "Small advice" in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRWoTgYbUqM&t=1498s) mean that explicitly specifying return type for public functions will noticeably improve compiler/IDE speed? If yes, it sounds like an inspection ü§î #Kotlin #IntelliJ 

There is "Public API declaration with implicit return type" inspection in "Kotlin->Other problems" disabled in the default profile. If it's really going to make difference and is recommended in general, should it be enabled then?

I'm pretty sure I read a few years ago that #Mastodon (social network) was named after Mastodon (a metal band). However, most articles I can find now are saying Mastodon (social network) was named after the animal. Does anyone know more of the backstory?

Videos from JVM Language Summit 2023 [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX8CzqL3ArzW90jKUCf4H6xCKpStxsOzp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX8CzqL3ArzW90jKUCf4H6xCKpStxsOzp) I enjoyed ["The Challenges of Introducing Virtual Threads to the Java Platform"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsCJYQDPrrE) üôÇ

It might be the "old man yells at cloud" problem but many tools which are supposed to empower developers are achieving the opposite. More levels of indirection, more configs, slow pipelines, etc. instead of faster feedback loops (on faster modern hardware). There is a joke that k8s is a conspiracy by big tech to slow down the rest of the industry üò≥

Here is the simplest way to implement any interface in #Kotlin üôà Aka mocking library in four lines of code. (I didn't come up with it though so can't take the credit.)

<kotlin>
class MyList&lt;T&gt; : List&lt;T&gt; by strictMock()

inline fun &lt;reified T&gt; strictMock(): T =
    java.lang.reflect.Proxy.newProxyInstance(
        T::class.java.classLoader,
        arrayOf(T::class.java)
    ) { _, _, _ -> throw NotImplementedError() } as T
</kotlin>

If you're interested in #Kotlin, [KotlinConf](https://kotlinconf.com) on May 23-24 next year will be a good excuse to visit Copenhagen. It's the same venue as in 2019 which was quite nice. And don't forget the best way to get the ticket is by submitting a talk [https://sessionize.com/kotlinconf-2024](https://sessionize.com/kotlinconf-2024) üôà (As always, you don't really need to be an expert in the field to do a good talk!)

Super slow search for #Kotlin data class components in IntelliJ is a massive contributor for me not enjoying Kotlin as much as I could. It feels that problems like this one are too fundamental to not be fixed on day one üòê Unreliable/slow search defeats the whole point of IDEs.
